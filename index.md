## Hi there!

I'm an architect from Universidad de Sevilla with a Master's degree in Timber Engineering from Universidad del Pa√≠s Vasco. Thanks to an internship grant, I had the opportunity to spend some time living and working as an architect in Japan, where I developed my interest in timber, carpentry traditions and tonkotsu ramen.

Now working as a consulting timber engineer at Tecnalia Research & Innovation.

I'm a programming enthusiast. I like to develop scripts and modelling tools to support my day-to-day work.

Brother of [alvaro.gs](https://www.alvaro.gs).
